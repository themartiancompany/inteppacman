## Name meaning

The name of this program is a pun on the Italian
expression *int 'e pacc man!"*, which roughly translates to
*(now it's) in your ass, man!"* and explicitly refers to how
this program, by directly extending pacman
to work on virtually all compatible computing platforms
as well as taking over their native package management
systems, is supposed to undo the damage decades of
evil corporative parochialism have
caused to software communities and societies in general.
